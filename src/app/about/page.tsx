          All our programs are based on the Learning by Doing methodology,
          encouraging students to develop problem solving, decision making and
          scientific inquiry skills and comprehend abstract concepts in a play
          way method. It allows them to investigate, plan, test and implement
          their ideas thus focus on application of the CS- STEM concepts and
          themes.
