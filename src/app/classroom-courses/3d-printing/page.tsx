          It is a process of making 3-dimensional solid object from a digital
          file 3D is shorthand for threedimensional. When you print a page on a
          printer, there are only two dimensions: the front of the page and the
          back of the page. Three-dimensional printing adds a third dimension,
          volume. 3D printing uses a printer to create three-dimensional
          objects, for example, a cup or doll or phone case and replaces the wax
          models. This technology is currently used in many fields such as
          health, construction, food, engineering, aerospace, etc.
