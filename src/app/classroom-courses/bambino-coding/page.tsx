          All our courses are specially designed based on the age of the child.
          In this course, the child will be introduced to basic fundamentals of
          coding in a fun and interactive manner. Learning a new language
          teaches children another way to communicate. As with learning any
          language, children should be exposed to coding at an early age. Coding
          teaches logical thinking and strengthens both written and verbal
          skills. Children who learn to code better understand how to organize
          their thoughts.
